# Waypoint üåç

A simple random coordinate generator because sometimes you just want to explore somewhere completely random.

## Why I built this

I love browsing Google Maps street view, but I kept finding myself only looking at places I already knew about. There's literally millions of interesting spots on Earth, but I was stuck in my bubble of familiar locations.

Then recently a friend randomly asked me to send them some coordinates, and I just typed something off the top of my head. That's when it hit me - why not make a simple tool that just spits out random coordinates? It's dead simple, maybe a bit stupid, but hey, it works.

## What it does

- Generates random GPS coordinates anywhere on Earth
- Toggle between "anywhere" (including oceans) or just continental areas
- Copy coordinates to clipboard
- Open the location directly in Google Maps
- Dark/light mode because why not

## Try it

## Tech stuff

Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Nothing fancy, just a clean little web app that does one thing well.
